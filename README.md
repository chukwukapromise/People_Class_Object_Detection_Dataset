# People Object Detection custom dataset

A high-quality custom dataset designed for training and evaluating object detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD, etc.) to detect people/person in diverse visual environments.

This dataset is publicly available for research, experimentation, and machine learning projects focused on human presence detection, surveillance systems, safety monitoring, and real-time AI applications.

📌 Overview

This dataset contains images of people in various environments, annotated for object detection tasks. It captures a wide range of instances, scenes, poses, scales, and lighting conditions to improve model robustness and generalization.

Key Features

🔹 Single class: person

🔹 High-quality annotations in YOLO or COCO formats

🔹 Diverse scenes: crowds, single person, partial occlusions

🔹 Suitable for advanced real-time object detection models

🔹 Clean folder structure for easy integration with training pipelines.


🧪 Use Cases

This dataset is ideal for:

🔹Human Detection

🔹Surveillance Systems

🔹Crowd Analytics

🔹Smart CCTV

🔹Pedestrian Detection

🔹Human-Robot Interaction
